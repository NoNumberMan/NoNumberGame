# NoNumberGame

Hi,
This is the repository of NoNumberGame: the game that I use for my tutorials on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOx8G19ALBxCSY1OKG6wQSA).

I encourage you all to take a look and use this code as a reference for your own games. Of course you could just copy everything, but I highly encourage you NOT to do that, as copying is not very educational and you will probably not learn how to do these things yourself.

Lastly, if you have any questions, please ask me directly through email (nonumbermandeluxe@gmail.com) or ask the community (incuding me) on the discord server (https://discord.gg/NBeUtzFaq6).
